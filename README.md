This project showcases using Microsoft Excel and Power Query for real-world data cleaning.
I worked with a dataset containing duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent data types. Using Power Query, I removed duplicates, filled missing fields (like Subscription and AmountPaid), and transformed the data into a clean, analysis-ready format.
This project is part of my data analytics portfolio and highlights foundational skills in Excel data prep.
